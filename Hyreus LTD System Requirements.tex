\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

1.1 Purpose of This Document

\vspace{2.5mm}

\begin{addmargin}[4em]{0em}

The purpose of this Systems Requirements document is to be used as a guideline throughout the development of the application. It will list the functional and non-functional requirements and their details. There will be a contain an User Interface section that details the front-end creation of the application. Each deliverable will be listed along with a due date for its submission. Lastly, open issues will be listed that will be further investigated and discussed the further the development process goes.

1.3 Purpose of the Product

\vspace{2.5mm}

\begin{addmargin}[4em]{0em}

Since the founding of the United States, gerrymandering has been used in order to strengthen one party's chance at winning an election. By splitting up voting districts strategically, parties skew the political landscape of their specific state, giving them an advantage. In a hypothetical situation, the districts would be divided in a way that portrays the actual data collected on registered voters. This program will provide the user with a way to see this hypothetical situation as well as create their own imbalances based on the percentages of party dominance they desire.
